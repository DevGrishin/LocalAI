# LocalAI

LocalAI is a C++/Qt 6 application that provides a ChatGPT-style interface to interact with local AI models using [Ollama](https://ollama.ai). It leverages QML for the UI and supports modern local LLMs with minimal overhead.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Local AI chat interface
- Modern QML-based GUI
- Integration with Ollama for local model inference

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

### ✅ Qt 6.5 or newer

Install Qt with the following modules:

- `Qt Quick`
- `Qt Sql`

You can install via [Qt Online Installer](https://www.qt.io/download) or through your package manager.

## 🧠 Install Ollama

LocalAI requires [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) to run local language models.

1. Download and install Ollama from [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. Start Ollama (it typically runs as a background service)
3. Pull a model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama2
   ```
   or a smaller version:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama2:7b
   ```
